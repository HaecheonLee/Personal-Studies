# Reviews 

### [1520A] 
- A simple implementation
### [1520B] 
- Got wrong, because I set wrong condition for loop
### [1520C] 
- Took longer time, because I thought it should be adjacent. Solved by pushing one down every index which is (index & 1) 
### [1520D] 
- Tried to look for a[i] - a[j] == i - j
### [1520G] 
- Dijkstra with brute-forcing search
