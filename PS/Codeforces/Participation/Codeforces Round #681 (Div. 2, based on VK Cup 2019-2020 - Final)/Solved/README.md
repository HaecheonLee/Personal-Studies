#[1443A] 
- I didn't really understand how it could be implemented, so I just ran it brute-force to check all possibilities since N <= 100
#[1443B] 
- I really messed up with the idea, first of all, I approached to the two ways like exploding all connected mines separately, and put all separated mines together. But, there were obviously wrong answers for some test cases, and later on, I realized that it should be done by checking the minimum cost of mines connecting, or separately exploding 
#[1443C]
- This was much easier for me compared to (B), just greedy problem
# Rest
- No time to solve the rest of problems
