### [1440A] 
- it was a brute-forcing problem
### [1440B] 
- it should be checking half on left side, and another half on right side, but at the earlier time, I only thought right side, and it was wrong. And another mistake for another test case when (N <= 2), i used constant number there. 
### Rest
- I spent 30 mins to solve C1 but I didn't even reach an idea to solve it, and I also tried to solve D(graph) and E, but it was way too hard to solve it
