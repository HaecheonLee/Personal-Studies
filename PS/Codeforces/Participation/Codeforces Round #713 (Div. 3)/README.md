### [1512A] 
- Got wrong due to setting wrong array size
### [1512B] 
- took longer time than I expected. I was confused how to code using two different coordinates
### [1512C] 
- brute-forcing. matching all the same first. And try to change '?' based on needed numbers 
### [1512D] 
- I got wrong, because I misunderstood the problem. I thought it should be a duplicate for the one at the end.
### [1512E] 
- Got wrong. I thought it could be done well when (K, (R - L + 1), - 1) is the sum from 1 to .. K - 1, and check if S - sum > K. but in the case 6 1 2 10 is totally wrong.
