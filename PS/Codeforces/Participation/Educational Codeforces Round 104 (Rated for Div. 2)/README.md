### [1487A] 
- A simple implementation problem to find if a[i] > a[j] (i != j)
### [1487B] 
- Kind of math problem. Should find all the meeting point during K move, so I assumed the meeting point is +2. The rest will be +1.
### [1487C] 
- A problem of construction. I grouped by 2 teams, so if there are odd number of teams, it should be one draw in a group of teams.
