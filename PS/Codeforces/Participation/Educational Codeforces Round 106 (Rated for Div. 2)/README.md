### [1499A] 
- (AC) Misunderstood the problem. Got 3 WA
### [1499B] 
- (AC) I used DP to solve it, but there was very easier way to solve it. Just find the rightmost x (s[x] == '0' && s[x - 1] == '0'), and the leftmost y (s[y] == '1' && s[y + 1] == '1'). If (x < y), the answer is YES
### [1499C]
- (WA) My idea was as closer as the solution, but failed in implementation
