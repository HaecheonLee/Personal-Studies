### [1481A] 
- Was very easy, but I didn't solve it fast, because I was confused with the condition in "if" statement.
### [1481B] 
- At the beginning, I had no idea how to solve it thinking binary-search. But later, I realized that the max of K is 100^2. So I ran it in brute-forcing.
Btw, I failed twice because I didn't think that it should restart the loop when a[i] < a[i + 1]
### [1481C] 
- I tried to solve using "set", with case by case. But, I failed to implement it. I should improve to simplify my idea and should understand of my idea perfectly.
