### [1506A] 
- a math problem. I was a little confused when (x % n == 0)
### [1506B] 
- I misused variables, so got 2 WA. I have to practice in coding in proper way
### [1507C]
- I solved it with dp. But I didn't consider when both string has no same character; it should be empty for both
### [1506D]
- Used pq for decrementing the first and second elements in the list
### [1506E]
- A simple greedy. Finding the maximum and minimum that can be used at given position
